# Poverty_Prediction_with_Satellite_Data
this paper avails an alternative source of data - satellite maps and imagery for poverty prediction in the context of Armenia. The findings prove, that a higher predictive power can be reached this way. Next, the employed model of Fixed effects of marz-level poverty prediction showcases that there is no significant marz-specific effect in poverty level, suggestive of no need of place-based policies in Armenia. The latter statement can be more accurately implied by future research that will involve a bigger scope of explanatory variables, possibly captured by alternative sources.
